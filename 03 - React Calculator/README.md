# React calculator app 
This is a react calculator , it is a simple project but it contains essential programming concepts that might seem difficult for most beginners. 
Dont worry you will get a hand of it in no time,  as i have broken it down for easy understanding.
A prior knowledge in react is needed to really understand what is going down.
Happy Hacking!!

<h3>install React</h3>
- Having installed  <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">npm & node.js</a>
- On the terminal navigate to the folder you want to store your react app folder
<br/>
- Enter the following code:
<code><span style="background:#adff2f;">npx create-react-app calculator </span></code>
</div>
<h3>Qualities that a calculator should have</h3>
- Contain clickable elements(0-9,.,=,operators,clear,all-clear)<br/>
- Display<br/>
- Numbers should not begin with multiple zeroes<br/>
- Only one "." should be allowed in a number<br/>
- The calculator must display the correct result<br/>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
