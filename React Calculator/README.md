# React calculator app 
This is a react calculator , it is a simple project but it contains essential programming concepts that might seem difficult for most beginners. 
Dont worry you will get a hand of it in no time,  as i have broken it down for easy understanding.
A prior knowledge in react is needed to really understand what is going down.
Happy Hacking!!
